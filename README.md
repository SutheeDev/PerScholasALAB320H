Welcome to R-ALAB320H.9.1, where I created a modern, intuitive, and minimalistic Todo List application designed for simplicity and ease of use. Built with React and CSS, this app allows users to efficiently manage their tasks with essential functionality.

<br>

## Features

1. Add New Todo

- An input field at the top allows users to create new todo items.
- Newly added todos appear at the top of the list, with older tasks displayed below.

2. Delete Todo

- Each task includes a "delete" button.
- The "delete" button is disabled unless the todo is marked as complete.

3. Edit Todo

- Each task has an "edit" button.
- Clicking the "edit" button replaces the task's text with a text input field, allowing modifications.
- While editing:
  - The "edit" and "delete" buttons are hidden.
  - A "save" button appears to save changes.

4. Save Edited Todo

- The "save" button saves any changes made to the todo via the text input field and updates the task.

<br>

## Design

The app features a simple, modern, and minimalistic design for a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Useds
